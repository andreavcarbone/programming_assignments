Statistics should be safe. This can be done by disseminating safe tools at undergraduate level. This is done by creating what he calls grammars of data analysis. These grammars should be flexible enough to solve several problems. This also entails constraints that stop users from doing something wrong. This grammar must be part of a programming language. For this students can be taught programming. They do not need to know everything about programming. Students can be taught simple tasks and then move on to more complicated stuff. It is vital for students to learn statistics, even if it is a difficult subject. The most important contribution teachers can make is teach them how to navigate the complexities of the field in the safest way possible.
